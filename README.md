# HTB-Labs-Machines
- Reports from [HTB Labs](https://academy.hackthebox.com) and [machines](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/list/active?sort_by=user-difficulty&sort_type=desc&difficulty=easy) I have done.
- It should serve as my portfolio of penetration tests and maybe analysis in the future.
- Sometimes I will try to write a semi-professional report, sometimes it is just a summary of steps I've done to achieve the goal.
- This repo isn't a guide how to solve the Labs / machines, it should showcase my skills.

### Reports sorted in chronological order from the newest
